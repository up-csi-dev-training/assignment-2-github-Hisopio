SZA - Hit Different feat. Ty Dolla $ign

I was into you from the beginning even if you wasn't mine
Scared to admit my shortcomings led to overdraft in this affair, declining
Quicker than we started, evidence we misaligned
Man, I get more in love (More in love) with you each argument
Somethin' wrong with me, I like the way you screw your face up
Trigger me right when I need it
You wrong, but I can't get along without you
It's a shame and I can't blame myself, keep on lovin' you
You do it different

All that I know is
Mirrors inside me
They recognize you
Please, don't deny me (Me, yeah, oh, yeah)

Hit different, hit different (It hit different)
Hit different, hit different (Hit different, ooh)
Hit different, hit different (Mmm)
Hit different (Ooh), hit different (Oh)
Hit different when I'm sittin' here
Alone, all by myself (Alone, all by myself)
Hit different when I think you might be
With somebody else (Na-na-na, na)
And it hit different, hit different (It hit different)
Hit different, hit different (Oh, na-na-na, na-na-na, oh)
Hit different, hit different (Mmm)
Hit different (Oh), this shit
Oh woah (Woah, woah, woah), yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh woah (Woah, woah woah), yeah

You still wit' it, when you want, ain't got to keep me, I am chill
Don't trip when you see me out, kickin' with my new bitch
I'll still hang around even though you cappin', cappin'
I could pretend you was my main nigga
Bet you love just how that feels (Oh, shit)
Out of my way, you out of pocket, need clear vision, boy (Vision)
Can't trust decision when you near me
Get myself caught in your crossfire
You a wild one, and I'm wading in you like it's cool water
Like it's cool when you pull up boo'd up with a new and it's not me
