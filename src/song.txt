SZA - Hit Different feat. Ty Dolla $ign

I was into you from the beginning even if you wasn't mine
Scared to admit my shortcomings led to overdraft in this affair, declining
Quicker than we started, evidence we misaligned
Man, I get more in love (More in love) with you each argument
Somethin' wrong with me, I like the way you screw your face up
Trigger me right when I need it
You wrong, but I can't get along without you
It's a shame and I can't blame myself, keep on lovin' you
You do it different

All that I know is
Mirrors inside me
They recognize you
Please, don't deny me (Me, yeah, oh, yeah)

Hit different, hit different (It hit different)
Hit different, hit different (Hit different, ooh)
Hit different, hit different (Mmm)
Hit different (Ooh), hit different (Oh)
Hit different when I'm sittin' here
Alone, all by myself (Alone, all by myself)
Hit different when I think you might be
With somebody else (Na-na-na, na)
And it hit different, hit different (It hit different)
Hit different, hit different (Oh, na-na-na, na-na-na, oh)
Hit different, hit different (Mmm)
Hit different (Oh), this shit
Oh woah (Woah, woah, woah), yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh woah (Woah, woah woah), yeah
